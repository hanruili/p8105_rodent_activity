# Welcome to the Rodent Activity Analysis Website

Rodents are more than just a nuisance in urban areas—they are a major public health concern. This website is dedicated to analyzing rodent activity trends in New York City (2020–2024) using advanced statistical and geographic analysis.

## Key Sections of the Website
Explore the following sections to dive deeper into our findings:
- [**Report**](Report.html): Key findings and insights from the analysis.
- [**Data Cleaning**](data_clean.html): A step-by-step explanation of how we processed the data.
- [**Rat Region Analysis**](Rat_region.html): Explore how rodent activity varies by geography and time.
- [**Rat Activity**](rodent_activity.html): Detailed analysis of temporal trends in rodent activity.
- [**Regression Models**](regression_models.html): Statistical models explaining rodent activity.
- [**Shiny App**](shiny_apps.html): Interactive tools to explore rodent activity data.

## Objectives of the Project
1. **Understand Temporal Trends**: How rodent activity fluctuates across seasons and years.
2. **Analyze Geographic Distribution**: Where rodent activity hotspots are in NYC and their correlation with food scrap drop-off sites.
3. **Assess Socioeconomic Impact**: How factors like rental prices and house values influence rodent activity.
4. **Build Predictive Models**: Use statistical tools to predict rodent activity based on temporal, geographic, and socioeconomic variables.

## Key Findings
- **Temporal Trends**: Rodent activity peaks in the summer months and decreases in the winter.
- **Geographic Insights**: Manhattan and Brooklyn have the highest rodent activity, while Staten Island has the least.
- **Socioeconomic Factors**: Rental prices and house values have a statistically significant but small impact on rodent activity.
- **Predictive Models**: Borough-level data and interactions between socioeconomic factors improve model performance.

## Meet the Team
This project was developed by the **P8105 Team** as part of a collaborative effort to address urban health challenges in NYC. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that help improve public health strategies.
