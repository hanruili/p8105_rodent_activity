# Motivation

Rodents in urban areas like New York City pose serious public health risks, from spreading diseases and contaminating food supplies to causing infrastructure damage. Addressing rodent activity is crucial for improving urban sanitation and residents’ quality of life. This report examines rodent inspection data, food scrap drop-off locations, and socioeconomic indicators to uncover the factors influencing rodent activity patterns.

# Related Work

Rodents have long been a public health concern in New York City, spreading diseases like leptospirosis and Hantavirus, and causing physical harm through bites (Brown & Laco, 2015). Auerbach (2014) estimated that NYC is home to 2 million rats, while Parsons et al. (2021) and Bedoya-Pérez et al. (2021) highlighted the significant societal costs, including food contamination, infrastructure damage, and economic losses. Encountering rats is common for NYC residents, driving the need to understand rodent activity and its link to socioeconomic factors for better pest control strategies.

# Research Questions

1. **Temporal Trends in Rodent Activity**  
   How does rodent activity vary across years and months?

2. **Geographic Distribution**  
   - How is rodent activity distributed across different boroughs?  
   - Which areas have the highest levels of rodent activity?  
   - Does the distribution of rodent activity correlate with the location of food scrap drop-offs?

3. **Socioeconomic Factors**  
   How are rental prices and house values related to rodent activity?

4. **Regression Models to Explain Rodent Activity**  
   - Does borough influence the relationship between socioeconomic factors and rodent activity?  
   - Are there significant interactions between socioeconomic factors and rodent activity?  
   - What is the best predictive model?

  - Extracted location (latitude, longitude, borough).

### 3. Socioeconomic Data
- **Data Source**: [Zillow Research Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/)  
  - **ZORI**: Measures typical observed market rent across NYC.  
  - **ZHVI**: Reflects typical home values across regions.  
- **Cleaning Method**:  
  - Extracted rental (ZORI) and home value (ZHVI) data for NYC by ZIP code.  
  - Merged socioeconomic data with rodent inspection data by ZIP code, borough, year, and month.

# Exploratory Analysis

### Step 1: Temporal Analysis
Objective: Identify patterns in rodent activity across months and years.
Methodology:
Aggregated rodent activity data by month and year.
Created a line plot to visualize trends across five years (2020–2024).
Justification:
Temporal analysis allows for the identification of peak rodent activity periods, essential for targeting interventions.
Seasonal trends (e.g., summer peaks) guided the focus on specific months like July for further analysis.

### Step 2: Spatial Distribution of Food Scrap Sites
Objective: Analyze the geographic availability of food scrap drop-off sites across boroughs.
Methodology:
Created a bar chart to summarize site counts by borough.
Generated a scatter plot and map to visualize site clustering and distribution.
Justification:
Understanding site distribution is crucial to identifying potential inequities in access to food recycling programs.
Highlighted boroughs with sparse coverage (e.g., Staten Island) to inform recommendations for program expansion.

### Step 3: Interaction Analysis
Objective: Explore the spatial relationship between rodent activity and food scrap drop-off sites.
Methodology:
Filtered rodent activity and food scrap data for July (a peak rodent activity month).
Overlaid rodent activity hotspots and food scrap site locations on an interactive map.
Justification:
Examining the overlap between rodent activity and food scrap sites provided insights into potential causal relationships.
Mapping data facilitated the identification of geographic areas requiring targeted waste management improvements.

### Step 4: Equity Analysis
Objective: Evaluate disparities in food scrap site distribution.
Methodology:
Aggregated food scrap site data by borough and identified underserved areas.
Analyzed borough-level demographics and population density to contextualize disparities.
Justification:
Highlighting inequities is essential for recommending resource allocation to underserved areas.
This step aligned with broader public health goals of ensuring equitable access to waste management programs.

## 2. Major Changes to Ideas

### Initial Assumptions:
Rodent Activity is Uniform: Expected rodent activity to be evenly distributed across months and boroughs.
Food Scrap Sites Have Minimal Impact: Assumed that proximity to food scrap drop-off sites had little to no influence on rodent activity.
Focus on Citywide Analysis: Planned to treat NYC as a single unit of analysis without differentiating boroughs.

### Evolved Insights:
Seasonality is Key:
Rodent activity is highly seasonal, peaking during warmer months. This realization shifted the focus to analyzing specific months like July.
Spatial Interactions Exist:
Significant overlap between rodent activity clusters and food scrap sites suggests a potential causal relationship.
Equity Matters:
Disparities in food scrap site distribution prompted a deeper analysis of borough-specific trends, particularly in underserved areas like Staten Island.
Policy Implications:
Initial focus was on identifying trends, but the findings necessitated actionable recommendations for waste management and rodent control.

*The steps taken, including temporal and spatial analyses, evolved significantly as insights emerged. The analysis transitioned from a broad, exploratory approach to a focused, actionable framework addressing seasonal trends, spatial interactions, and equity concerns. These changes demonstrate the iterative nature of data analysis, where new findings guide refinements to initial ideas.*

# Statistical Analysis

## 1. Rental Price and Rodent Activity
- **Model**: Logistic regression of rodent activity on rental price.  
- **Result**: Rental price has a statistically significant but negligible positive effect on rodent activity.

## 2. House Value and Rodent Activity
- **Model**: Logistic regression of rodent activity on house value.  
- **Result**: House value has a statistically significant but negligible negative effect on rodent activity.

## 3. Borough as a Confounder
- **3.1 Borough and Rental Price**:  
  - **Model**: Linear regression of rental price on borough.  
  - **Result**: Rental price varies significantly by borough, with higher prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
- **3.2 Borough and Rodent Activity**:  
  - **Model**: Logistic regression of rodent activity on borough.  
  - **Result**: Borough is significantly related to rodent activity.

## 4. Interaction Term of Rental Price, House Value, and Borough
- **Result**: Significant interactions exist between borough and rental price/house value, especially in Brooklyn and Queens. Interaction effects improve predictive accuracy but add complexity.

# Discussion

## Findings
1. Rental prices and house values are statistically significant predictors of rodent activity but with negligible individual effects.  
2. Borough is the strongest predictor of rodent activity, with differences across boroughs.  
3. Models with interaction terms provide better predictive accuracy.  
4. Spatial overlap exists between rodent activity hotspots and food scrap drop-off locations.

## Insights
- **Borough-Specific Policies**: Tailor rodent control strategies to borough-specific conditions.  
- **Waste Management**: Enhance infrastructure in high-activity areas.  
- **Seasonal Interventions**: Focus efforts during peak summer months.  
- **Housing Economics**: Improve housing quality in high-activity areas for long-term benefits.

# Limitations

1. Modest effects of rent and home value suggest other unmeasured factors (e.g., hygiene, building age) are more strongly associated with rodent activity.  
2. Data inconsistencies may affect reliability (e.g., reporting bias in rodent activity data).  
3. Interaction effects increase model complexity without always improving predictive value.

# Conclusion

Rodent activity in NYC is a multifaceted issue influenced by borough characteristics, socioeconomic factors, and waste management practices. Borough remains the strongest predictor, but incorporating housing economics provides additional context.
